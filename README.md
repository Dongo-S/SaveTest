# SaveTest

## 
This is a Save test made in Unreal Engine 5.

It will save the boxes locations/rotations on quit game and load them on startup.
On [Releases](https://github.com/Dongo-S/SaveTest/releases) there are two Windows builds, the difference is a #define that will store the save data on %appdata% (platform_1) or %localappdata% (platform_2).
